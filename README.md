# Student-Employment-Role-Prediction-by-using-Machine-Learning
Its depend on the real time application of Artificial Intelligence based Machine Learning technique to predict the Student Employment role Prediction.
We Use Five Modules are:
Datasets Collection
Datasets Preprocessing
Data Visualization using EDA Method
Model Implementation using Three types of Machine Learning algorithm like Gradient Boosting Machine Algorithm, Support Vector Machine and KNN.
Final Prediction based on two criteria:
Prediction of Student got the employment or not.
Accuracy Score of each and every Algorithm shown and comparison of each and every algorithm shown.
